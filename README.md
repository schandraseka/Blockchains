# Blockchains
Work on various implementations regarding blockchains
1. Creation of merkle tree
2. Validation of element's membership in merkle tree
3. Simulation of double spend attack

ToDo:

1. Simulation of selffish mining
2. Difficultly adjustment algorithm
3. Patricia Merkle trees
4. Program etherum with solidity
5. Enhance blockchain using invertible bloom lookup tables
6. Low variance mining using bobtail or DAG based blockchain?
